# [Maintain a secure repository by using GitHub best practices](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/training/modules/maintain-secure-repository-github/?ns-enrollment-type=Collection&ns-enrollment-id=mom7u1gzjdxw03)

Learn best practices for building, hosting, and maintaining a secure repository on GitHub.

### Learning objectives

In this module, you will:

* Identify the tools and GitHub features to establish a secure development strategy
* Enable vulnerable dependency detection for private repositories
* Detect and fix outdated dependencies with security vulnerabilities
* Automate the detection of vulnerable dependencies with Dependabot
* Add a security policy with a `SECURITY.md` file
* Remove a commit exposing sensitive data in a pull request
* Keep sensitive files out of your repository by applying the use of a `.gitignore` file
* Remove historical commits exposing sensitive data deep in your repository

### Prerequisites

* A GitHub account
* The ability to navigate and edit files in GitHub
